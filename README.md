# arlington-access

Arlington Access is forked from [Open Access Control](https://code.google.com/p/open-access-control/) 
to control RFID access to the Riverside.io space. 

## Usage

To login to the rasberry pi at the space do the following swapping
`port`, `username`, and `ipaddress` for the proper credentials. Request
those credentials from an active member.

```
ssh username@ipaddress -p port
```
